          I live in Portugal with my partner Ana, we have recently just bought our first house, which we share with the real owner, our cat Loki. I like to unwind by creating music, painting or playing video games.
          <br/><br/>  
          I started considering web design as a potential career in 2020. During the pandemic, I didn't want to waste time indoors when I was given the perfect opportunity to use the isolation to study.
          <br/><br/>
          Before that, I had completed a degree in Music, Business and Management, spent 14 years in retail management, 1 year in project management and several other jobs in between it all. I found my own way to both lead and be led as part of a cohesive team.
          <br/><br/>
          I found several courses, and applied myself to everything I could. Some styles stuck, some didn't. I realised those that did had a design that really struck with me. So I focused on UX/UI design, using React.
